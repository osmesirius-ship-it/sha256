## I. PREPARATION AND TIMING

### Critical Timing Considerations
According to the **Portae Lucis Method of Jean Dubuis**:
> *"The period of two weeks prior to and following the Winter Solstice is to be avoided for all Alchemical, Qabalistic work, or the charging of these products."*

However, the Winter Solstice itself represents the **"excess of darkness over light"** and is the precise moment for **rebirth and regeneration**.

### Sacred Space Preparation
- **Purification:** Begin at sunset on the evening of the Solstice
- **Direction:** Face North (the direction of the Winter Solstice in the Great Table)
- **Elements:** Represent the four quarters with candles: North (Earth), East (Air), South (Fire), West (Water)
