### Positional Mapping Results
**Format**: Page | Paragraph | Word | Extracted Text | Positional Index

#### Sample Extraction Template
```
Block: [9-digit number]
Page: [calculated page number]
Paragraph: [calculated paragraph number]  
Word: [calculated word number]
Text: "[extracted word content]"
Index: [page.para.word positional reference]
```

### Archetypal Scoring Results
**Format**: Word | R1 | R2 | R3 | R(w) Score

#### Sample Scoring Template
```
Word: "[extracted word]"
R1 (letter-sum mod 37): [calculated value]
R2 (word length): [calculated value]
R3 (archetype weight): [calculated value]
R(w) total score: [calculated value]
```

### Resonance Ranking

## Instructions for Verifiers
1. **Page Count**: Count total pages in PDF edition
2. **Paragraph Boundaries**: Identify all paragraph breaks
3. **Word Tokenization**: Split on whitespace, strip punctuation
4. **Positional Mapping**: Apply block → page/para/word formula
5. **Scoring**: Use exact R1/R2/R3 formula
6. **Documentation**: Record all intermediate values
7. **Validation**: Compare with expected patterns
