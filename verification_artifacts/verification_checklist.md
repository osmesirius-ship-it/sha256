Cloud Verification Checklist
========================

## Pre-Verification Requirements
- [ ] Confirm exact book edition: "The Secret Teachings of All Ages" (1928)
- [ ] Verify book file integrity (SHA-256 checksum)
- [ ] Confirm three input strings match exactly
- [ ] Validate normalization rules applied correctly

## Algorithm Verification Steps
- [ ] D0 calculation matches expected value
- [ ] 9-digit block generation correct
